			<h1>A Long Way Gone</h1>
			<p>A Long Way Gone is the true story and memoir of Ishmael Beah. It describes his life in Sierra Leone as he is seperated from his parents at the age of 12 after loosing them and the rest of his village to rebel groups. He and his friends had left the village for a trip to a hip-hop competition and little did they know they would not go back. Ishmael is later recruited by RUF who are recruiting child soldiers to fight in the war. He slowly sees himself turn into a war machine as killing becomes like "drinking a glass of water" as all his emotions are repressed with durgs such as coacaine, marjiuana, and "brown brown". Eventually Ismael is handed over to the care of a rehabilitation center where he experiences great kindness and eventually learns to open up again. He is then put in a program to bring him to the United States where he recieved a foster mother and family. He now works as an accomplished novelist.</p>

				<h4 style="color: rgb(212,175,55);">The Culture</h4>
				<h1>Cultural Components</h1>
				<p>At the time the novel takes place the country of Sierra Leone was dominated by the War and unrest. There are cultural components present in the beginning such as the love for American hip-hop music and the poofy clothes but after the rebels attack the book becomes much darker as it describes Sierra Leone's Civil War, gore and all, and the recruitment of the child soldiers.<br><br>

					The civil war of Sierra Leone began in 1991 after the neighboring Liberian rebels spilled over the border to repel the incursion of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia(NPFL). Sierra's Leon army under attack on two fronts however. One from the NPFL, the other from the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) who was collaborating with the Liberian rebels. It began a long brutal civil war (Fyfe).<br><br>

					RUF started recruiting child soldiers to fight in the war, including demobilized child soldiers, to join its ranks and engage in combat. The children were being placed in the front lines of the combat according to Peter Takirambudde (Sierra Leone Rebels Forcefully Recruit Child Soldiers). Ismael Beah explains the phenomenon and why they choose children to fight in the war. Children are easily to manipulate. In addition, with the state in which Sierra Leone was in, children long for order, to be a part of something. Being a part of the ranks ensures that and gives them people to be with. <br><br>

					According to Ismael's memoir, the child soldiers were trained to be killing machines and emotions were not allowed. If a boy cried because he missed his father he was shot. They also were given drugs such as marijuana and cocaine to suppress the emotional implications of their actions (Barnett).<br><br>

					This war and history will forever be an important part of Sierra Leones history and culture. As the war has changed the very foundation of th enation itself.

			<h4 style="color: rgb(212,175,55);">What About Now?</h4>
			<h1>Current Events</h1>
			<p>The Sierra Leone Civil War is now over. Beah is still a novelist and has recently written a fictional novel on the after affects of war in his book "Radiance of Tomorrow". He has received recent criticism and skepticism on "A Long Way Gone" and how much of it is actually truth. Although it annoyed Beah, he says he ignored it and that the book is fact and written to the best of his recollection. He says he removed any parts of the novel he was doubtful about and that it has been fact checked, after all they don't let anyone simply publish a memoir without checking it's accuracy.</p>
